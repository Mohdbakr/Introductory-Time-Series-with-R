```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r AirPassengers}
data(AirPassengers)
AP <- AirPassengers
AP
```
All data in R are stored in objects, which have a range of methods available. The class of an object can be found using the class function:

```{r ts-class, echo=FALSE}
class(AP)
start(AP); end(AP); frequency(AP)
```
try typing summary(AP) now to see what happens
```{r}
summary(AP)
```

One of the most important steps in a preliminary time series analysis is to plot the data; i.e., create a time plot. For a time series object, this is achieved with the generic plot function:
```{r ts-plot, fig.cap="International air passenger bookings in the United States for the period 1949â€“1960."}
plot(AP, ylab = "Passengers (1000's)")
```

```{r}

```
